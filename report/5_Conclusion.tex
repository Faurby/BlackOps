-\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:mpt}
During the span of this project, we have not only learned how to manage and maintain a cloud service, but also how to develop a product using a DevOps mindset. In addition, we have learned about the operation of different tools and techniques, that have helped maintain the health of our service. 
\\\\
Furthermore, we have expanded our previous knowledge of terms such as \textbf{Continuous Integration} and \textbf{Continuous Delivery}, which have given us an understanding of the importance of the automation of inconvenient tasks. Moreover, we have achieved a fundamental understanding of how to develop a product using a DevOps mindset, and how it may differ from the standard developing process. The DevOps philosophy presents developers with a way to improve a continued customer satisfaction, along with a way of reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks.

In conclusion, the course \textit{DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Maintenance} has given us a new and different perspective into the development world. It has provided us with a new approach to handling the development of cloud services, as well as raised our current level of understanding regarding web development. DevOps is a concept and a philosophy that we hope to bring with us in the future, offering a new outlook on the challenges we are going to encounter not only in school, but also working professionally.
