\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:mpt}

The following report was written as a part of the course \textit{DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Maintenance}. This report will take an in depth look at the final product made by us,  \textit{Group G - Call of Duty BlackOps} consisting of the following members: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Anton Dalsgaard Bertelsen \{adbe@itu.dk\}
    \item Anton Lukas DÃ¸rge Friis
    \{anlf@itu.dk\}
    \item Caspar Marschall
    \{cafm@itu.dk\}
    \item Frederik Rothe
    \{frot@itu.dk\}
    \item Lasse Faurby Klausen
    \{lakl@itu.dk\}
\end{enumerate}

During this course we learned to refactor a legacy code base to work on a more modern system, as well as maintaining and improving the system while in use. The product that we needed to maintain was a social media platform working similarly to the microblogging and social networking platform \textit{Twitter}. With the help of a script and an API, we could simulate a scaling amount of users using our platform by signing up, following other users and posting messages. The intensity of requests started out very low, but would from then on exponentially increase until the end of the simulation, mimicking the growth of our platform. This was done to increase the difficulty of maintaining of the system as well as increasing the severity of mistakes, bugs and server failures. 

The platform was accessible on \textit{http://157.230.107.58:5142} until the 10th of May, 2022, where after it was taken down.
